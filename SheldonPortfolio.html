                <p>Yo! My name is Sheldon, I’m currently living Minnesota which is also where i grew up. The past 5 years of my life I lived in Los Angeles, California and really grew as a human, met a lot of celebrities and made a few close friends that will be around for the rest of my life. Before moving to LA I lived in Utah for winter as a snowboard coach for Westminster College and before that I coached in MN for 4 yrs.

                    <small><i>“Keep it simple stupid.” </i></small>
                <p> My background is a long list of things starting with going to college at the MN Art Institute 
                    in 08’ or 09’ (don’t even think it’s there anymore) I was fresh out of college and had no idea 
                    what I wanted to do. So, I decided to do Graphic Design. Graduated with my Associates. I graduated 
                    early because while at Ai I found I loved to dj. So, I bought Ableton, a cheap Numark mixer and 
                    started to dive into the electronic music scene. I always at least once a year look back at where 
                    I started with music and “CRINGE!” I was so bad, but didn’t care because I was decent at djing and really 
                    enjoyed it. I also went to another school in St. Paul called “Mcnally and Smith” Where I really learned the 
                    in’s and out’s to music and what I wanted to learned. It was really the music theory and ear training classes
                    that helped the most. While I was going to school I was still snowboarding and started coaching in 2012 around 
                    the year I graduated Ai. So, I think either a year or two in Mcnally, I dropped out and moved to Utah around 
                    2015 to coach snowboarding at Westminster College.</p>

                <p> I coached for four years prior to moving to Utah with a group called G team out of Buck hill and Hyland 
                    (“Ski & Snowboard resorts?, hills… Ski & Snowboard Hills”) It was an absolute rewarding experience I miss every 
                    day. With all the experience I have in snowboarding to teach it to someone who is just learning or wants to learn 
                    a new trick, then seeing them actually listen to what you said and achieve their goal is a great feeling. 
                    At my fourth year with G Team I got an offer from a local rep who liked the way I coached and wanted me on his 
                    team, but thought it would be weird going to another team in the same state. So, he got me in contact with the 
                    Utah team and I jumped on it.</p>
                    
                <p> My 2015-2016 snowboarding season was me riding Park City and Brighton literally everyday. It was a dream and I 
                    got in shape, I studied each rider prior to joining the team and I was named the Head coach. Something I never 
                    thought I would be doing as a snowboarder.  Because of that, Imposter syndrome was in full effect and self-doubt 
                    was always there. But, everyday I got to be on that mountain as a Snowboarder just riding with my team made 
                    everything Gucci. We had competitions that we had to travel for so I got to go to some of my favorite mountain, 
                    Mammoth Mountain: CA, Copper Mountain: CO, Winter Park: CO and ended the year with Regionals in New York 
                    at White Face mountain. This was where you compete with all the the other schools. The end result was Mens got 
                    second overall and Women’s got First. Ended the year a high note.</p>
                    
                <p> Once that season ended I packed my Chevy S-10 hammy-down up and drove 26 hour straight back to MN. The last 8 
                    hours I was so tired and decided to play Incubus: Morning view, Make yourself and Light Grenades, Red Hot Chili 
                    Peppers: Californication, By the way and Stadium Arcadium  with a little bit of Offspring, System of the Down 
                    and Rage Against the Machine to get me home.</p>  
                    
                <p>2016-2017 I was in MN for the summer working and figuring out what I wanted to do. Didn’t want to do another year 
                    with Westminster because the pay wasn’t ever going to be what I wanted and I need to figure out a career. Out of 
                    the blue my brothers girlfriend at the time, now family friend, offered me a place to stay for 6 months and a job 
                    in the Entertainment Industry. So, August 4th 2017 I moved to California with a suitcase full of cloths going to 
                    work and figure out what I wanted to do with my life. From 2017-2022 I did just that and now am looking to secure 
                    a 9-5 for security so I can continue with the hobbies I want to pursue.</p>

                <p>I have always found it fascinating just never had the chance to follow through. After working the Sound Design gig 
                    I found working with a team is something I have missed out on and since the time was right I wanted to just dive 
                    in and figure it out after. And of course the job security, the amount of jobs available on all levels is attractive.
